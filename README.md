# simplego
Simple implementation of the board game Go for professional development. No AI, not currently planning state checking advanced enough to confirm if board state is repeated (may change my mind). Focusing on implementing the capture mechanics with my current skillset, might implement a scalable board, not planning on adding handicap mechanics.
